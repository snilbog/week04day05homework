## QUnit Lab

Your assignment is to take a function from your game project, describe the parameters and return value to your partner, and have
them write a unit test for it.

This may require re-writing the function from your game, or may require creating a function that encapsulates the functionality you want to test.
All this is fine, since learning TDD is partially about changing the way you code, and partially about learning how to write tests.
