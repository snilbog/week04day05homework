#WDI SEA 05 Homework repository

All homework will be turned in to your fork of this repository daily.

##Setup

**IMPORTANT!!! DO NOT DO THIS UNTIL INSTRUCTED TO DO SO.** We will do this process together on the first day of class.

To set up your initial homework repository do the following:

* fork repo
* clone forked repo
* cd in to newly cloned repo
* mkdir **GIT-USER-NAME**
* cd **GIT-USER-NAME**
* echo "#**YOUR NAME**'s Homework repo" > readme.md
* git add -A
* git commit -am "inital commit"
* git push

**GIT-USER-NAME** should be replaced with your actual git user name (must be exact)

**YOUR NAME** should be your actual name.



##Submit homework

Each day you will submit your homework by doing the following:

* git add -A
* git commit -am "inital commit"
* git push
* go to github.com (navigate to the repo)
* create pull request

####Pull request details

(Must be in this format)

**Title:** `w##d##`

Replace ## with week and day number (eg w01d02  = homework for week 1 day 2)

**Message:**

```
comfort: #
completeness: #

Message about your experience goes here
```

Replace the `#` next to comfort/completness with a number (1 - 5) to represent how comfortable you are with the topic and how much of the assignment you were able to complete.

1 being the lowest and 5 being the highest (most comfortable / complete)

##Folder Structure

By the end of this course you will have a lot of assignments in this repository and it will get pretty unwieldy if you don't start it out with some strcture. This is how we recommend you organize your homework repository.

```
